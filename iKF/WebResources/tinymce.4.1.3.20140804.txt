- 4.1.3 No compat3x plugin is included in the package, but we are not necessary - because the plugin enables to use plugins designed for tinyMCE 3, we never use the such plugins, so I REMOVED.
- 4.1.x Bug for css file location in local has been fixed! we can use css file in local use!
- Prod version of the code is only 300K, whereas dev version is 1.9M we should use prod version. This version is prod version
